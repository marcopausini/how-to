* Activate BSC VPN

== Start tightvnc server process
* Open terminal in Windows (e.g., MobaXterm), connect to satu 
----
ssh mpausini@ssh.hca.bsc.es
#enter the password for hca
ssh satu
#enter the password for hca again
----
* On the remote machine launch `w`, observe if there is a tightvnc server process running already, take note of the session number
* To kill an existing session:
----
tightvncserver -kill :4 # kill previous sessions to restart from scratch
----
* To re-launch:
----
tightvncserver -geometry 1920x1080
----

== Connect to remote desktop 
* Open a new terminal on Windows and establish a tunnel to satu using the number of the vnc session from previous step, assume :4 was given by previous step for this example, assume port 4444 is free, if not use different port number:
----
ssh -C -t -L 5901:localhost:4444 mpausini@ssh.hca.bsc.es ssh -C -L 4444:localhost:5904 satu
#enter the password for hca twice
----
* Open the vncviewer app on Windows
Establish a session with localhost:5901
If requested insert the password given when tightvncserver was setup.

This should open your remote desktop, from there open xterm and source the EDA environment:

----
source /eda/env.sh
----

Now you should be finally able to run EDA tools, for example:
----
vlog
vsim
dc_shell
fm_shell
genus
